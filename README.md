### Kasper Hoel (kazpeh)

This is the GitHub page for my hobby projects. They are mostly experimental and should not be used professionally.

A list of some of my projects are:

- **Allviz**, a small and bare-bones Agent-Based Model library, helping to build models for use in, for example, economics, such as industrial organization, taxation, public policy, etc., and other fields based on an ECS architecture-
- **NUTN** is quite a popular website I made to help students at NTNU traverse all the university's IT-systems. It can be visited at https://kazph.github.io/nutn/
- **SPAR-9000** is an AI to play "spar-dame," a card game using Bayesian updating as the driving force behind the algorithm.
- **Chock-chart** is an experimental chart-maker to make simple and beautiful charts. It's extensible using Tailwind CSS and HTML instead of only SVG like most software, then converting to PDF.
- - **Sedoku Rescue** iis a straightforward Sudoku solver that utilizes constraint propagation to efficiently solve (still only simple) puzzles.

And more!

I often switch between public and private visibility when working on projects for my own sake, so if you want to continue my experimentation, I recommend you cloning the repository!

Thanks!
